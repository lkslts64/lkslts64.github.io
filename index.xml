I am a software engineer from Greece interested in large scale distributed and concurrent systems. I also love Go which is best suited for the implementation of those systems. Aside from engineering, I like playing board games, listening to electronic music and watching alternative movies.</description></item><item><title>Landing my first job as a Software Engineer</title><link>https://lkslts64.github.io/posts/firstjob/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 23:06:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lkslts64.github.io/posts/firstjob/</guid><description>I was always looking forward to my first interview(s). I wanted to see how I could perform under heavy pressure and how my skills are compared to other candidates. At the end of November, I started applying for job openings. My strategy was simple: I would only apply for openings whose job description heavily matched my interests, but this condition should be relaxed for positions offered by top tech companies. So, in order to get hired at one of those companies, I was willing to accept working on something that did not align completely with my interests and the technologies I am skilled in.</description></item></channel></rss>
