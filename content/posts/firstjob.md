I was always looking forward for my first interview(s). I wanted to see how myself
performed under heavy pressure and how my skills are compared to other candidates.
Don't ask me why, maybe I had insecurities about my engineering skills, who knows.
At the end of November, I started applying to job openings. My strategy was 
simple. At first, I would apply to the ones I was most interested in (obviously) 
or the ones I had heard that were top tech companies. In order to work for a top-notch company, I was willing to accept an offer that did not align completely with my interests and the technologies I am skilled in. That decision was also made because my main language is Go, a technology that is rarely used in Greece.

## __First interviews__

Fast-forward one week later, and I had been rejected by nearly all the companies I had applied to. I was a bit disappointed, but that feeling went away pretty quickly as the next couple of days I scheduled a couple interview calls. I was a lot of nervous, but I also had been prepared for some common interview questions and that made me less stressed. It turned out that I wasn't asked none of those questions. Instead, most interviewers were asking me about my previous projects,
which I'd been working on university. I felt this was great! I would keep talking
about technology and analyze my thoughts about each project with some experienced 
tech people! The fact that I enjoyed the process was a key to my success as I 
passed nearly all first round interviews. 

## __The dream job description__ 

5 days later, and I got an offer! The job title was *Golang Software Engineer* that
would work with (amongst others) *Kafka* and *Cassandra* - i.e. large distributed systems that I am interested in -. That was nearly the perfect job description I could have! But something was wrong. I felt that my skills weren't tested 
as much during the interviews. They had given me a homework assignment which was 
relatively easy and took me approximately one day to finish. Judging from their interview process, I felt that they make offers without thorough examination of the candidates and that would perhaps increase their [false positives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives), resulting in hiring average engineers.  Ideally, I wanted to be asked some challenging questions during the interviews and maybe take part in a live coding interview. And suddenly... I had my opportunity! I got an email from a top-notch Greek company named Skroutz! They wanted to schedule a first call with me.

## __Skroutz__

Before the call, I was so nervous. Despite I had done that a handful of times before, it felt like it was my first time. I also had read about their [hiring process](https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/hiring-engineers-while-working-from-home/) which was very robust. Fortunately, the three interviewers were very friendly and made the whole process less stressful. They asked me some questions about web architecture (HTTP, DNS, TLS etc) and I was able to answer the vast majority of them. Fast-forward 5 days later, I got an email from them telling me 
that they would like to proceed at the 2nd round of the process which is a __coding interview__. I had 10 days to prepare so every day I was solving at least 4 [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems of medium difficulty. I also read the [interview handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook). At last, the interview day came, and I rocked it! I was able to communicate my solution very well with the interviewers
and I was explaining while coding. I finished 15-20 minutes before the 45-minute threshold 
which was another plus. The next day we scheduled the third call which was about
system design. For this round, I studied from the [system-design-primer repo](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer). Finally, I did the third and final interview. My performance wasn't as good as the one at the coding interview primarily because of my lack of knowledge about 
web applications and databases design. The interviewer warned me that if I eventually come at Skroutz, I should be putting a lot of effort into learning all these things I'm lacking of. His words made me a bit more skeptical about this position. 

## __The Dilemma__

Do I really want to work on an e-commerce web application (i.e. Skroutz) writing Ruby on Rails? Probably the answer is no, but on the other hand, I would be working closely with highly talented engineers in an amazing environment. 
Do I want to work with Go and distributed systems? Definitely yes, but on the other hand the working environment maybe won't be as good as Skroutz's.
Clearly, I had a dilemma. In my opinion, on these situations, the best thing someone has to do is to follow his/her *instinct*. 

At the end, I definitely enjoyed the whole job 'hunting' *journey*, and surely I gained some confidence.  

## __Some words about the interview process__

There is a big debate on whether the interview process applied by top companies is broken. Why someone needs to study things that potentially won't be needed for the actual job in order to prepare for such an interview? In addition, coding interviews are extremely stressful and one needs to prepare a lot before one. 
But, this approach works quite well for the companies, that's why they haven't given up. If anyone wants to join a top company, he/she has to comply. The good things is that anyone who has a problem-solver attitude and loves challenges will also love the types of problems asked in those interviews.
