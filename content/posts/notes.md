*  Maybe TDD (Test driven development) is worth it When working in a large company. In a company with lots of layers in hierarchy, Some pieces of information may get lost As they travel downstream. For example, you are assigned an issue That is poorly described At the issue tracker with lots of ambiguities, And your senior doesn't explain it further to you Because, lets say, he is out of time. As a Junior Without extensive experience,you wrongly think that The implementation will be straightforward and Start working on it. After a few days you submit a pull request. You get some feedback from your senior and you realise that you haven't quite understand What the issue is all about And that's normal because it was ambiguous from the start. But what if you designed the tests first? You would be forced to think about The output of your system and thus, eliminate any early Ambiguities.
The above statement's value Depends a lot on your seniors. It is their duty to disambiguate the issue.
